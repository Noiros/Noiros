## 👋 About Me

I am **Nicolas**, a Belgian independent game developer specializing in **Gameplay Programming**. I started coding **9 years ago** as a self-taught programmer, which helped me build a strong practical foundation.

My goal is to create unique and captivating gaming experiences, which I primarily develop through my studio **Vedg Studio**.
